Customer Churn Prediction ML System
An end-to-end machine learning project developed to predict customer churn and help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving.
 Project Overview
This project implements a production-style machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, serialization, and API deployment for real-time predictions.
 Key Features
- Built a Random Forest classifier to accurately predict customer churn.
- Performed data preprocessing, label encoding, and feature scaling.
- Engineered relevant features to improve model performance.
- Serialized the trained model using Pickle for reuse.
- Developed a FastAPI application to serve real-time predictions.
- Designed the system to reflect a real-world ML deployment pipeline.
 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, FastAPI
 Business Value
Enables organizations to proactively identify high-risk customers and take strategic actions to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.
 How to Run
1. Install required dependencies  
2. Run the training script  
3. Start the FastAPI server  
4. Send requests to the prediction endpoint
